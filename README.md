# git-my-tools
A set of scripts I used to work with git

git clone the repo, and run .\setup.cmd

Open new command windows, and you can use the scripts, such as:
origin: open remote repo page
pr: open pull request page
push: push your change to remote, will take care of the upstream branch automatically
resetm: always get a clean up to date main branch
deletebranch: batch delete local branches, except for the main branch and current branch
deleteremotebranch: batch delete remote branches
mycmd: list the cmd supported
mytools: open the folder where the scripts are located
